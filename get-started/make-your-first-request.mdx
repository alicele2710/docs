<Note>
  Your API keys carry many privileges. Be sure to keep them secure! Do not share your API keys in publicly accessible areas such as GitHub or client-side code.
</Note>

## Creating API Keys

To create a new API key:
1. Navigate to the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com)
2. Go to Settings → API Keys
3. Click "Create New API Key"
4. Name your key and select the appropriate permissions
5. Copy and securely store your API key - you won't be able to see it again!

```bash
# Example of using your API key
curl -X POST "https://api.mindee.net/v1/parse" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -F "document=@invoice.pdf"
```

## Managing API Keys

### View Active Keys
You can view all your active API keys in the Dashboard under Settings → API Keys. For each key, you can see:
- Key name
- Creation date
- Last used date
- Permissions

### Rotating Keys
We recommend regularly rotating your API keys as a security best practice:
1. Create a new API key
2. Update your applications to use the new key
3. Delete the old key

### Revoking Keys
To revoke an API key:
1. Go to Settings → API Keys
2. Find the key you want to revoke
3. Click "Revoke Key"
4. Confirm the action

<Warning>
  Revoking an API key immediately invalidates it. Make sure you've updated your applications before revoking old keys.
</Warning>
